WORKING TITLE - MANC DICTIONARY

THIS IS A LITTLE PROGRAM I HAVE BUILT CALLED THE MANC DICTIONARY.
IT STARTS WITH A SMALL DICTIONARY OF MANCUNIAN SLANG WORDS/PHRASES AND THEIR DEFINITIONS.

IT THEN GIVES THE USER OPTIONS TO BOTH READ AND WRITE TO/FROM THE DICTIONARY.
EITHER SEEING THE WORDS/PHRASES AND THEIR DEFINITIONS, ADDING THEIR OWN WORDS/PHRASES OR EDITING WORDS/PHRASES AND/OR THEIR DEFINTIIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE DICTIONARY.

THE PROGRAM IS ALL RUN THROUGHT THE TERMINAL AND I HAVE TYPESET AND JUSTIFIED THE TEXT A LITTLE TO MAKE IT A MORE USER FRIENDLY AT THE FRONT END
